= TEST PROJECT =

It's a exercise for a grails position. Must be completed in 3 hours. An pdf file with description could be found in the root folder.

Application is a front-end to register users and incudes a Rest service to permits to reuse the functionality. 

Requirements and assumptions

* Application could be consumed fot other grails applications, and non grails applications (mobile, j2EE ..)
** For this reason de app is not a  grails plugins

* The application uses a command object model to centralized validation. User registration sometime requieres validations that
 are out of domain classes scope (like password validation)

* The application is designed to be open to new changes (there was doubt whether the requirements).
** com-en , com-br are not domains valid. Should they get from user locale or HTTP_REFERER?

* have done tests, but not strict TDD
